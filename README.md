I am currently a coding bootcamp student with General Assembly. I am on track to graduate at the end of November, 2022. In the meantime, I am excited to learn more about the industry and leverage my problem-solving skills and creativity to a lifetime of learning.

Currently, I am advancing my proficiency in JavaScript to create my first, full project to add to my portfolio. 

I'm looking forward to connecting with other junior developers to work on collaborative projects and continue honing my technical skills.
