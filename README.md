# Hello there! I'm Christina.

I am currently a coding bootcamp student with General Assembly and on track to graduate at the end of November of this year. In the meantime, I am excited to explore the industry and leverage my problem-solving skills and creativity to a lifetime of learning with other like-minded individuals.

As I continue honing my technical skills, I look forward to connecting with other developers to work on creative and innovative projects.
